        <h3>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation of Volkswagen AG</h3>
        <div class="project">
            <div class="content">
                <p>Using several approaches, Volkswagen AG (VW) is valued on January 01, 2024. Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) approach is performed with an assumption of constant debt ratio over time. Using Adjusted Present Value (APV) with a constant debt amount over time, the result is deviated from the market cap. By adjusting the debt amount over time, the estimated equity value intersected with the market cap of VW. Further, sensitivity analysis is studied on WACC approach and pointed sensitive parameters of the company. Option to wait one year is studied with empirical free cash flows (FCF). Also, Merton model is applied to find the adjusted debt ratio and credit spread with accounting default risk.</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global stock markets, particularly during the early stages before its official declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the outbreak rapidly spread, the potential for spillover effects became a substantial risk for financial markets. This paper investigates the effect of COVID-19 on stock market returns, specifically focusing on the geographical proximity to the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan. By examining the relationship between distance to Wuhan and stock market returns, this study aims to shed light on the influence of geographical proximity on the financial implications of the pandemic.</p>

                <p>The study presents three different approaches to applying the GMM in order to estimate the two parameters (β and γ) of the Consumption-Based Asset Pricing Equation (BAPE), which employs a power utility function and gross returns. The three approaches that aim to solve the minimization problem of the Objective-Based GMM are:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Performing a grid search that relies on a fixed set of values for β and γ.</li>
                    <li>First-stage GMM.</li>
                    <li>Second-stage GMM.</li>

        <div class = "project">
            <div class = "content">
                <p>Next is an assessment of how well each method fits the data, including computing the correlation between the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) of each method and the consumption growth. Different approaches include plotting model-implied mean returns against the market returns and conducting hypothesis testing for the most conventional values for β = 1 and γ = 10, and commenting on the spread range of the confidence interval, especially for γ.</p>

                <h3>AKIS - Deep Learning Transcription Tool for Ottoman Writings</h3>
                <p>We propose an automatic recognition system for printed Ottoman documents which transcribes Ottoman texts directly to the modern Turkish script. We evaluated three decoding strategies including the Word Beam Search decoder that allows to use a recognition lexicon and n-gram statistics during the decoding phase. The system achieves 2.25% character error rate and 6.42% word error rate on a test set of 1.4K samples, using the test set transcriptions as the recogni- tion lexicon. Using a general purpose, large lexicon of the Ottoman era (260K words and 77% test coverage), the performance is measured as 3.68% character error rate and 16.61% word error rate.</p>

            <p>
            I led improvements to DeepKinZero, enhancing its predictive capabilities by refining similarity calculations based on cellular component features. Utilizing Gene Ontology IDs and protein location data, I applied the Wang and BMA methods to measure semantic similarity between proteins, resulting in a significant boost in DeepKinZero's performance. Through thorough analysis and testing, I confirmed the reliability of the implemented features and spearheaded the implementation of new features using TensorFlow. </p>
